# repoproxy

## About

repoproxy is a caching web proxy that caches Linux repositories for multiple client nodes.

The main differences between this approach and the regular approaches is that repoproxy will:
 * only cache what you need
 * store its cache in the same layout as the upstream repo

It started life as [node-proxy](https://github.com/dansimau/node-proxy).
